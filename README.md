# Flat Data Demo - Python Postprocessing

This demo is part of a larger Flat Data project created by [GitHub OCTO](https://octo.github.com/). Read more about the project [here](https://octo.github.com/projects/flat-data).

While our [canonical Flat Data example](https://github.com/githubocto/flat-demo-bitcoin-price) uses Deno for postprocessing, [@pierrotsmnrd](https://github.com/pierrotsmnrd) has made an example that uses Python for postprocessing. Check out the example here: [https://github.com/pierrotsmnrd/flat_data_py_example](https://github.com/pierrotsmnrd/flat_data_py_example)
